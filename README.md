# UMGC_SDEV_Lab4

This program uses the numpy module to do arithmetic operations with matrixes. In the program you provide two 3 x 3 matrixes and then choose from a list of operations to perform on the matrixes. The program will do these 4 operations:

1. Addition
2. Subtraction
3. Matrix Multiplication
4. Element by Element Multiplication

The program also does error checking and input validation, shows the transpose of the matrix after each operation, and will keep running the program unless otherwise told to stop via prompt.
